Hi! Welcome to my github page, here you may find some projects I have worked on in the last year and a half. You can check out my **ProjectsPortfolio** repository to check an overview of some of the projects I'm most proud of. Here you can find projects that involve Data Science, Heuristics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Definetly you will find lots of AI and Python. 

I am very passionate about contributing to make the world a better place through AI.
