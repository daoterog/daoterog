# A little bit about me...

Hi! Welcome to my github page, here you may find some projects I have worked on in the last two years. Here you can find projects that involve Data Science, Heuristics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Definetly you will find lots of Python and AI. I am very passionate about contributing to making the world a better place using AI. I am constantly trying to improve my abilities, learn, and to be involved in impactful projects.
